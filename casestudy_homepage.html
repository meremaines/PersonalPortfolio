        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
        <div class="one-half left">
          <p>After eight months without any updates, there was no denying the Chemyx, Inc. homepage could use a facelift. But a homepage doesn’t just serve as curb appeal.</p>
          <p>Together with my team of a Ph.D. scientist, a copywriter, a UI designer, and a developer, I wanted to do more than just upgrade the look.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-half right">
          <p>Armed with user research and a collaborative approach from the team, I wanted to ensure our site’s first impression would better convey our desire to meet multiple perspectives of customer needs.</p>
        </div>  
      </div>
      <div class="the-problem left">
      <a name="the-problem"></a>
        <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
        <div class="one-third side-call">
          <p>The existing homepage was created before I came on staff at Chemyx, and while it did serve one purpose as an uncluttered front door to the site, there was room to make it more functional for users.</p>
          <p>When we began this project, Google Analytics showed 37 percent of our traffic entered the site through the homepage—the most frequently used entry point. To this point, our team had spent the majority of our time improving pages deeper in the purchasing funnel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-third mid-call">
          <p>We felt it was time to climb back out and make sure we were capturing as much traffic as possible through this highest-trafficked first impression.</p>
          <p>The existing homepage had a lower-than-expected bounce rate, less than 40 percent, even while ranking as the most frequent starting point for site visitors. But the team rightly noted that the page content merely mirrored the elements in the top navigation. The page didn’t offer any inherent value of its own. It also didn’t expressly give customers a reason to believe in our market authority.</p>

        <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
        <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS VIA USER TESTING</h4>
        <div class="one-half left">
          <p>I wrote a user test within Usertesting.com’s platform to compare the experience of our homepage v. several of our competitors. We don’t have high levels of brand recognition as do many of our better-known industry peers, so I knew it would be important to learn what elements on our competitors’ homepages struck potential customers as trustworthy, in an attempt to hold our own against them.</p>
          <p>I developed a participant screener to seek out testers who work or study in scientific research fields, scientists who not only use syringe pumps but who also have some say in the equipment purchases for their research labs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-half right">
          <p>With the help of the team, I chose four competitors of varying size and credibility to test against to see how we compared across the spectrum. The test platform then recruited three participants per competitor comparison who recorded their screens and audio as they provided feedback throughout the script’s tasks.</p>

        <div class="one-half left">
          <p>The testers’ insights showed me we needed to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use photography that includes people using the equipment to make a human connection as well as adding context to the product’s usability. Our testers pointed out whenever they noticed stock photography of a generic lab environment.</li>
            <li>Explain which problems our pumps solve for different research applications. This would increase confidence that 1. the product would work for their specific needs and 2. the products could be trusted because the manufacturer is well-versed in scientific processes.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="one-half right">
          <ul>   
            <li>Add elements that will serve as product reviews. Though most scientific manufacturing sites like ours don’t seem to have a streamlined way of collecting public product feedback, our customers are still consumers with Amazon-esque expectations.</li>
            <li>Make some sort of allusion to the product pricing upfront. Before continuing further, users wanted an idea of the financial commitment necessary. This presented a challenge for us as our pricing is contingent on location.</li>

          <h4>PERSONAS</h4>
          <div class="one-third left">
            <p>This project relied on our team's exisiting marketing personas that I helped create alongside the marketing manager. The entire site, and especially the homepage, needs to speak to our three main groups:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>scientist end user</li>
              <li>potential distributor partner</li>

          <h4>USER STORIES / TASKS</h4>
          <p>User stories helped me determine and prioritize MVP features for both new, returning, and super users. I also developed a nice-to-have list of features for future sprints—streamlined social connectivity to Goodreads, a virtual book club, and an easily filterable event calendar that syncs to iCal or Google Calendars.</p>

          <p>User flows helped me identify and communicate to the team the additional pages we'd still need to create to be able to catagorize our products by series and application. Though this would merely require publishing under an existing page template built by our developer, I wanted to ensure all UI and marketing copy would be accounted for on these new pages. These additions should also help our SEO rankings in these specific market areas.</p>

          <h4>LOGO BEFORE</h4>
          <div class="one-third left">
            <p>The library’s existing logo was designed as a nod to the parish’s local Red River, but it did not have an approachable, welcoming sense and was also hard to place.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="two-thirds right">

          <h4>LOGO AFTER</h4>
          <div class="one-third left">
            <p>For an updated logo, I pulled from another familiar Louisiana motif&mdash;the pelican. I wanted to use an animal character to add personality&mdash;approachability and friendliness&mdash;to the library system.</p>
            <p>I created a suite of pelican marks that can be reduced to two colors or one, depending on production requirements. The bird sits on a book with curved pages as a nod to the local waterway.</p>
          </div> 
          <div class="two-thirds right">

        <div class="local-color left">
          <h4>LOCAL COLOR</h4>
          <div class="one-third left">
            <p>To take the existing logo in a different direction, my color inspiration came from the branch buildings themselves. I used a color picker on photos of local library branches, then extrapolated a color scheme from this jumping off point.</p>
            <p>For typography, I again referenced the local branches’ outdoor branding and went with an all-caps serif font for the title in the logo.</p>
            <p>Martel has large counters and bowls that lend open, approachability, and its descenders and terminals are open as well. It has a traditional feel without being stuffy—perfect for a public community service—for use in headers.</p>
            <p>Open Sans is optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms; I’ve implemented it as body copy and within form fields. Legibility is very important in this project because it needs to appeal to all demographics.</p>
